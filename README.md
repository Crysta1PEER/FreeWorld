   #1. Clone from GitHub: Execute the following code
   git clone https://github.com/Crysta1PEER/free_world_h5
   #This method may not be friendly to users in mainland China, but it can get updates promptly.
   #Sync the repository to your local machine by executing in the project root directory: git pull
   #2. Project Zip from Other Channels
   #We do not recommend using this method, as it will not get the latest version of the repository content.
   #After obtaining the zip file, you can unzip it directly and view the actual running effect by accessing the html file, but any changes you make will not be synchronized to the Internet.
   #3. Access the Internet site
   #Directly enter this webpage through the Internet, which will consume your data usage.
   #Since most of the functions of this project are for demonstration purposes, using it for actual production may reduce efficiency. Therefore, many resource-intensive features have been used, and the actual effect may differ from the preview.
3. After registering a Free World account, you can connect to the remote server directly by using the provided IP address and port number. (Not yet implemented)
