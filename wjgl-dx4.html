          Does the "contrast cute" goat in the trailer make you curious? Goats are born in the extreme mountain biome,
          they like
          to jump around in the snowy cliff area, can be called the natural "high jumper" in the square world! During
          the trip,
          adventurers need to be careful if there are "grumpy" goats on the road that suddenly come at you. If you have
          the wheat
          he loves,
          Then it will turn into a "gentle little sheep" at your side to accept feeding ~

          In addition to the bouncing goats, this time there are dynamic and luminous squid and cute axolotl along with
          the
          attack. The cute Axolotl is a friendly aquatic creature. Although it is cute in appearance, its actual
          fighting power
          can not be underestimated. Interestingly, it has a certain chance to pretend to sleep when it is hurt! And the
          glowing
          squid that adventurers refer to as the "moving cursor" is actually a variant of squid,
          When you beat the luminous squid, you also get a special drop object fluorescent ink sac.
