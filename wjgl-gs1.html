          Hello, everyone. This is the architect Dwarf. From today on, I will bring you a super detailed architectural
          guide! So
          that adventurers can easily build a unique beautiful building.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          First of all, how to build a hotel full of rural flavor! This construction uses a large amount of wool, logs
          and stones,
          suitable for adventurers who have survived in the world for a certain period of time and have a small savings.
          Without further ado, let me begin to explain the building process step by step.
        </p>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-8 offset-md-2"><a href="img/gs1-1.png" target="_blank"><img class="img-thumbnail"
                src="img/gs1-1.png" style="margin-top: 10px; "></a></div>

        </div>

        <h5 style="font-family: algerian;margin-top: 20px;text-align: center;">Build foundation & lay floor</h5>
        <P>
          First, you need to find a large enough open space, and then use logs in the open space to build a hollow
          square with a
          length and width of 16 squares as the foundation, and each side of the square needs to be placed four vertical
          logs for
          the next step.
          Since this project is to create a rustic style building and will eventually use leaves as decorations, it is
          recommended
          to use dark logs to build the foundation frame,
          If adventurers want to try a desert style hotel, then sandstone is also a good choice of foundation material.
        </P>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-8 offset-md-2"><a href="img/gs1-2.png" target="_blank"><img class="img-thumbnail"
                src="img/gs1-2.png" style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 30px;"></a></div>

        </div>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
          This introduced hotel will be officially completed! This hotel style is natural, not too gorgeous, suitable
          for use in
          rural buildings, or adventure maps, building materials can be freely switched according to the preferences of
          adventurers, and the style of the map, the shape of the building can also be more personalized adjustment, is
          a very
          easy to use and expand the building.
          This is the Dwarves, I hope you adventurers can build their own favorite building! Let's see you next time.
