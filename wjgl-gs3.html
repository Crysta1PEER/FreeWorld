          Hello, everyone. This is the music lover. - Dwarves! I wonder if you adventurers like to make red stone music?
          Today we will bring you about the most basic component of red stone music - the note box!
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The note box can be activated by Redstone, making a sound at the same time, and showing a note jumping out.
          Adventurers
          can adjust the pitch of the note box with a right mouse click, and each click causes the sound of the note box
          to rise
          by a half-note a half-note is an intermediate note between two pitches, C sharp half-note =D flat half-note,
          for
          example, The black keys in a piano are the two adjacent white keys that represent the pitch.
          Different pitches are also represented by notes of different colors and sizes.
        </p>

          The above is the whole content of this walkthrough, do not know whether the adventurers have learned the use
          of note
          boxes? Although it looks easy, it actually involves a lot of music theory knowledge. I hope you can make your
          own music
          in my world.
          This is the guide, wish the adventurers enjoy playing in Minecraft, we will see you next time!
