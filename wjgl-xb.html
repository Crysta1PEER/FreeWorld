          Hello everyone, I am the farmer dwarf, here to introduce you about animal domestication skills, hope to help
          you
          adventurers become big farmers! First up is an animal that can help us get through the night quickly - sheep!
          Where does
          the Raider come from? What will it produce?
          How is it domesticated? What are its features? These four aspects for adventurers to introduce this creature
          in detail.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Where did it come from? It is everywhere, as long as there is enough sunshine and grass, sheep will be like
          other
          animals quietly generated in your side, generally speaking, sheep are white, but occasionally there will be
          some sheep
          with other colors of wool, such as black, gray sheep, sheep, sheep, sheep.
          So if you don't have anything to gather wool for a while, or if you have nothing in your stomach, grab some
          wild sheep
          -- they'll come back anyway.
        </p>

        </h5>
        <P>
          What will it produce? Sheep drop their wool and mutton when they die, and like other animals, if a sheep is on
          fire,
          It's gonna be cooked lamb. But dwarves here are very not recommended to use the way to kill sheep to get wool,
          its
          efficiency is very low, tantamount to killing the egg, the correct way is to hold a pair of scissors, aim at
          the lamb's
          body press the right button, the wool will easily fall off - and the wool will grow automatically after a
          period of
          time,
          Thus, a barn with a large enough number of sheep can provide a continuous supply of wool without worrying
          about the
          depletion of resources.
        </P>

          That's all for this animal training guide! I wonder if the adventurers have learned how to tame sheep for
          wool? In
          future episodes, like this one, I will introduce you to various types of animals that you can breed on your
          own farm,
          Good luck to all adventurers. This is the Dwarves. See you next time!
