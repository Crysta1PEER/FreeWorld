          Hello, everyone! This is the Raider who loves to catch little monsters! In the previous walkthrough, I
          successfully
          captured the most common five bad guys, and have introduced you to three of them, in this walkthrough, I will
          introduce
          you to the crawler bad guy, popularize its habits and characteristics,
          So that everyone can protect themselves from this bad guy in their future home life.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Now, let's get to know the bad guy we're going to introduce! It is the worst nightmare of your home life!
          After a soft
          hissing sound, countless friends' homes were destroyed in a loud explosion! That's right!
          The protagonist of this introduction is one of the representative creatures of My World - the creeper!
        </p>

        <h5 style="font-family: algerian;margin-top: 20px;text-align: center;">A creeper looking through glass</h5>
        <P>
          The creeper is green, distorted, and full of obsession with you, and it will always be generated at night, or
          on the
          brightness of less than seven square, and it is determined to have a spectacular meeting with you.
          To this end, it will even take the initiative to jump off high platforms and cliffs, just to give you a bang
          debut. And
          what's even scarier is that the creeper is not a creature of the undead, so it can't die naturally from
          sunlight,
          Nor will the spider be calmed by the coming sun, but it still longs for a sparkly embrace with you.
        </P>

          The above is all about the crawling content, I don't know if you have learned about how to deal with the
          crawling little
          knowledge?
          The Guide will continue to introduce more knowledge about Minecraft's creatures,
          I wish you all enjoy playing the game! This is the Raider. See you next time!
