          Hello, everyone, here is a long time no see of the raiders, so long time no, give you secretly say a surprise
          oh! The
          Raiders have successfully captured the bad guys who usually roam at night, looking to attack their friends and
          villagers! However, the Raider does not want to simply lock them up, but intends to take this opportunity to
          popularize
          these bad guys to your friends,
          Good to avoid it in the future home travel and so on - the Raiders decided to call this series of
          introductions the
          Hostile Creatures Handbook!
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          So without further ado, let's get into the most common bad guy group, let's welcome - the everyday bad guys!

        </p>
        <div class="row">

        <P style="margin-top: 25px;text-indent: 4em;">
          Let me introduce you, from left to right:
        </P>
        <p style="text-indent: 8em;">Prowling in the shadows, the spider!</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 8em;">Come and go without a trace, the mighty Enderman!</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 8em;">Want to give you a warm hug, so excited to explode, creeper!</p>


        <p style="text-indent: 8em;">Swish into your heart, the skeleton of the warrior of love!</p>

        <p style="text-indent: 8em;">Who wants to get up close and personal with you, zombie!</p>

          These five bad guys sneak up on you as soon as it gets dark,
          Whether you're in the desert, jungle, or underground, they can sneak up from around the corner,
          Then do your best to help you get home for free, and now let me introduce you one by one, this time I will
          tell you
          about two hostile creatures - spiders and Endermen.

        </P>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-8 offset-md-1"><a href="img/xb5-2.png" target="_blank"><img class="img-thumbnail"
                src="img/xb5-2.png" style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 30px;"></a></div>

        <p>
          Endermen drop Ender pearls, which can be used to form the Eye of the Ender to find fortresses leading to the
          End, and to
          teleport over short distances - as long as you can withstand the damage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's wrap this up for the Enderman. He teleports, he goes berserk, he steals from your house, but he's afraid
          of water!
          Bring a pumpkin and you won't be afraid to look him in the eye.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
          That's all for this guide. In the next introduction, I will continue to introduce this group of common hostile
          creatures
          and bring you a cure for the zombie virus.
